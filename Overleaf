% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is to develop a cost-efficient and scalable WSN-based home automation system. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard was chosen for its suitability for low-power and low-cost IoT applications. We analyzed different network topologies to identify the most efficient configuration, ultimately recommending Star topology for its balance of scalability and performance. This report summarizes the methodologies, results, and findings of our project.

% Background
\section{Background}
With the rise of IoT applications, WSNs play a critical role in enabling seamless and energy-efficient connectivity. IEEE 802.15.4, a standard for low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs), provides a robust framework for implementing such systems. We utilized OMNet++ for simulation, leveraging its flexibility to test various network configurations and evaluate performance metrics like latency and packet delivery ratio.

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Performance Evaluation for Large Scale Star Topology}
Ziyad K. Farej and Ali M. Abdul-Hameed, in their paper \textit{Performance Evaluation for Large Scale Star Topology IEEE 802.15.4 Based WSN}, analyze the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 WSNs using the OPNET simulator. They identify optimal settings—230 nodes, a packet size of 2048 bits, and a PIT of 2 seconds—for maximizing throughput and minimizing delays. The study highlights the star topology's efficiency for low-latency applications like biomedical monitoring while recommending tree or mesh topologies for extended coverage. This work provides valuable insights into optimizing WSN configurations for scalable deployments \cite{farej2015performance}.

\subsection{Building IEEE 802.15.4 Accelerators}
T. Gomes et al., in their paper \textit{Building IEEE 802.15.4 Accelerators for Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Nodes}, present an FPGA-based accelerator for IEEE 802.15.4 networks targeting IoT applications. The proposed solution offloads packet filtering and processing tasks from the microcontroller, reducing system overhead by 17\% and improving availability by up to 59\%. This enables energy-efficient operation and better handling of high data loads in resource-constrained WSNs. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of heterogeneous architectures in enhancing WSN performance, making it a key reference for optimizing IoT-based network systems \cite{gomes2018accelerators}.

\subsection{Modeling and Optimization of IEEE 802.15.4}
Pangun Park et al., in their paper \textit{Modeling and Optimization of the IEEE 802.15.4 Protocol for Reliable and Timely Communications}, introduce a Markov chain-based model to optimize IEEE 802.15.4 medium access control parameters. Their adaptive algorithm minimizes power consumption while maintaining reliability and delay constraints, making it highly suitable for dynamic wireless sensor network (WSN) environments. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in addressing energy efficiency and communication reliability without requiring modifications to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, providing a strong foundation for enhancing protocol performance in IoT and industrial applications \cite{park2010optimization}.

% Problem Statement
\section{Problem Statement}
Traditional home automation systems struggle with scalability and cost efficiency. Our project aims to address these issues by designing a WSN-based solution that optimizes network performance and minimizes delays while adhering to the constraints of IEEE 802.15.4.

\subsection{Description}
The system connects multiple sensors to a central controller, enabling real-time monitoring and control. This configuration allows for efficient management of resources while maintaining low latency and high reliability across the network.

\subsection{Calculations}

\textbf{Latency:}
\[
\text{Latency} = t_{\text{receive}} - t_{\text{send}}
\]
where \( t_{\text{receive}} \) and \( t_{\text{send}} \) represent the time when a packet is received and sent, respectively. Latency measures the delay between the transmission and reception of data, which is critical in real-time monitoring applications.

\textbf{Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR):}
\[
\text{PDR} = \frac{\text{Packets Received}}{\text{Packets Sent}} \times 100 \%
\]
This metric indicates the reliability of the network by measuring the percentage of successfully received packets relative to the total packets sent.

\textbf{Energy Consumption:}
Evaluates the power efficiency of the network. Energy consumption is an important factor in WSNs, especially in scenarios with battery-powered devices. Minimizing energy usage while maintaining performance is essential for the sustainability of the system.

\subsection{Software and Hardware}
\textbf{Software:} OMNet++ simulation environment, which is used to model and simulate the WSN's behavior and performance under different conditions.

\textbf{Hardware:} IEEE 802.15.4-compatible modules, which provide the communication interface for the sensor nodes and central controller in the WSN.

\subsection{Topology}
\textbf{Star Topology:} Centralized communication with minimal delay.

\textbf{Mesh Topology:} Robust but introduces higher latency due to multi-hop communication.

\textbf{Peer-to-Peer Topology:} Direct communication but less efficient for IEEE 802.15.4 networks due to the lack of centralized coordination.

\subsection{Comparative Analysis}
Star topology outperforms other configurations in scalability, low cost, and efficiency. It ensures lower delay and higher packet delivery consistency. Peer-to-peer, while offering simplicity, struggles with scaling. Mesh topology is robust but incurs high delays and increased complexity.

\subsection{Bar Chart Analysis}
A bar chart comparing end-to-end delay, PDR, and throughput for each topology highlights Star Topology's superior performance. Delays are minimal, and delivery rates are consistently high.

\subsection{Discussion on Results}
The results validate Star Topology as the optimal choice for IEEE 802.15.4 applications requiring scalability and efficiency. While Mesh topology is more robust for larger, dynamic networks, its delay variability makes it less suitable for low-latency requirements. Peer-to-peer excels in small, decentralized applications but struggles as the network grows.
